# What is it?
This whole project is my attempt to learn [zig](https://ziglang.org/) and understand it's weak and strong sides.
Link to puzzle list [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

# About solutions
1. Use priority queue for 3 elements to avoid whole list sort.
2. Calculate scores by the description from puzzle. Zig gives ability to generate switch cases in compile time.
3. Find common rucksacks element by two static bit sets.
4. Just detect overlaps in linear segments.
5. Use array of stacks and temporary stack to simulate crate movings. 
6. Sliding window and bit set for marking distinct characters.
